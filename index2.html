        <ul>
            <li>He renounced his German citizenship when he was 16.From an early age, Albert Einstein loathed
                nationalism of any kind and considered it preferable to be a “citizen of the world.” When he was 16, he
                renounced his German citizenship and was officially state-less until he became a Swiss citizen in 1901.
            </li>
            <li>He married the only female student in his physics class.Mileva Marić was the only female student in
                Einstein’s section at Zürich Polytechnic. She was passionate about math and science, and was an aspiring
                physicist in her own right, but she gave up those ambitions when she married Einstein and became the
                mother of his children. (Watch: “When Albert Met Mileva”)</li>
            <li>He had a 1,427-page FBI file.In 1933, the FBI began keeping a dossier on Albert Einstein, shortly before
                his third trip to the U.S. This file would grow into 1,427 pages of documents focused on Einstein’s
                lifelong association with pacifist and socialist organizations. J. Edgar Hoover even recommended that
                Einstein be kept out of America by the Alien Exclusion Act, but he was overruled by the U.S. State
                Department.</li>
            <li>He had an illegitimate baby.Einstein’s future wife Mileva gave birth out of wedlock to a baby girl in
                1902 while staying with her family in Serbia. The baby was named Lieserl, and it’s believed by
                historians that she either died in infancy, probably of scarlet fever, or was given up for adoption. In
                all likelihood, Einstein never saw his daughter in person. Lieserl’s existence wasn’t widely known until
                1987, when a collection of Einstein’s letters was made public.</li>
            <li>He paid his first wife his Nobel Prize money for a divorce. Anticipating winning a Nobel Prize, Einstein
                offered all his expected prize money to his first wife, Mileva Marić, so she would agree to grant him a
                divorce. The award added up to $32,250, which was more than ten times the annual salary of the average
                professor at the time.</li>
            <li>He married his first cousin.Elsa, the second Mrs. Einstein, was the daughter of Albert’s mother’s
                sister, making them first cousins. They were also second cousins, as Elsa’s father and Albert’s father
                were cousins. Her maiden name was Einstein.</li>
